# Stimulus
This repository contains all the stimuli that are being used in behavioral 
and electrophysiology experiments. 

In the StimulusSelector.m we first set our desired stimulus to run.
There is a parameter file in ParameterFiles folder related to each stimulus 
type. That should be modified for setting the relevant parameters of the 
stimulus before running the StimulusSelector.m.
